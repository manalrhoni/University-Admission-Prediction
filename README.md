# 🎓 University Admission Prediction 

This project aims to analyze university application data and develop a predictive model to classify candidates as "Admitted" or "Rejected." 

As data analysts, our approach focused heavily on understanding the variables, cleaning the data, and properly preparing it before modeling.

## 🛠️ Steps Undertaken:
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Correlation study (Heatmap) and analyzing the impact of CGPA, GRE, and TOEFL scores.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outlier detection/removal, and feature standardization.
3. **Handling Class Imbalance:** Applied Random Oversampling techniques.
4. **Modeling (Machine Learning):** Trained and compared a Logistic Regression model and a Decision Tree classifier.

## 📈 Key Results:
* The **Logistic Regression** model delivered the best performance with an accuracy of **~93%**, showing a great balance in limiting both false positives and false negatives.
* The analysis confirmed that the **CGPA** is the most determining factor in the admission process.
